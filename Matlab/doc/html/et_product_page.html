Emission Tomography Toolbox for Matlab lets you do Tomographic Reconstruction for 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). <br />

Emission Tomography Toolbox tailors computational efficiency and ease of use:
the core functions are implemented in C and made available to Matlab through 
mex files. <br />

All core functions can also optionally make use of GPU acceleration if a CUDA compatible 
device is installed in your pc. GPU acceleration provides a speedup of up to 100 times, enabling 
fast 3D reconstruction in seconds! <br />

The core functions implement Rotation-Based Projection and Backprojection with (FFT based) Depth-Dependent 
Collimator Detector Response (CDR). <br />

All functions are compatible with 2D and 3D data sets. <br />

The following iterative reconstruction algorithms are provided: Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM), Maximum A Posteriori Expectation Maximization (MAPEM), Gradient Ascent (GA) Maximum Llikelihood and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP). <br />

The Emission Tomography Toolbox also implements a number of priors for multimodality-aided Maximum A Posteriori reconstruction: Total Variation, 
Joint Entropy based prior, Class Conditional Joint Entropy, Bowsher. <br />
